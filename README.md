# WEB - Work In Progress

This is the complimentary Flutter Web implementation for [stripe_payment](https://pub.dev/packages/stripe_payment)

* First stage of implementation:
    * StripePayment.setOptions
    * StripePayment.paymentRequestWithNativePay
    * StripePayment.completeNativePayRequest
    * StripePayment.deviceSupportsNativePay => always true
    * ~~StripePayment.paymentRequestWithCardForm~~
    * ~~StripePayment.confirmPaymentIntent~~
    
## Notes

- stripe_sdk expects the total as int in the smallest currency units, this plugin expects double. How to convert? For now hacked * 100

## Breaking changes
 - canMakeNativePayPayments is no longer bool but returns null if native pay is not available or `CanMakePaymentResponse` 
 containing `bool isApplePay`
  
## Setup
Include `<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>` in your `web/idex.html`
